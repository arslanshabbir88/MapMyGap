- AC (Access Control) - User access, authentication, authorization
- AU (Audit & Accountability) - Logging, monitoring, audit trails
- IA (Identification & Authentication) - User identity, multi-factor auth
- SC (System & Communications Protection) - Network security, encryption
- IR (Incident Response) - Security incidents, response procedures
- CM (Configuration Management) - System configs, change management
- CP (Contingency Planning) - Business continuity, disaster recovery
- AT (Awareness & Training) - Security training, user awareness
- CA (Assessment & Monitoring) - Security assessments, compliance
- PE (Physical & Environmental) - Physical security, facilities
- PS (Personnel Security) - Employee screening, background checks
- MP (Media Protection) - Data storage, removable media
- SI (System & Information Integrity) - Malware protection, updates
- MA (Maintenance) - System maintenance, patches
- RA (Risk Assessment) - Risk analysis, threat assessment
- SA (System Acquisition) - Procurement, vendor management
- SR (Supply Chain Risk) - Third-party risk, vendor security

Return only the 3-5 most relevant family codes as a JSON array, like: ["AC", "AU", "IA"]
