[33m8faef9d[m IMPROVE: Smart document chunking strategy - Preserves full document content while staying within timeouts - Short docs (20K): Full content - Medium docs (20K-30K): First 25K + summary - Long docs (>30K): First 25K with 5K overlap + summary - Prevents AI from missing important compliance evidence
[33m660d40f[m OPTIMIZE: Reduce AI processing time to prevent Vercel timeouts - Shortened prompt from 200+ lines to 15 lines - Reduced client timeout from 150s to 55s - Limited document content to 20K chars - Reduced maxOutputTokens to 32K for faster processing
[33m1a75fc2[m REVERT: Change project name back to MapMyGap from AlignIQ - restore original branding across all files
[33m87732a5[m CRITICAL FIX: Resolve all codebase inconsistencies - rename project to AlignIQ, remove duplicate files, standardize modules, clean dependencies
