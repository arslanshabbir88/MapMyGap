        {
          q: "What is MapMyGap?",
          a: "MapMyGap is an AI-powered compliance gap analysis platform that helps organizations assess their compliance with cybersecurity frameworks like NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and PCI DSS. It analyzes your documents and identifies gaps in your compliance posture."
        },
        {
          q: "How does MapMyGap work?",
          a: "You upload your compliance documents (policies, procedures, etc.), select the framework you want to analyze against, and our AI analyzes the content to identify which controls are covered, partially implemented, or have gaps. You get a detailed report with actionable recommendations."
        },
        {
          q: "What types of documents can I upload?",
          a: "We support PDF, DOCX, and TXT files. You can upload policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, and any other compliance-related documentation. The AI will analyze the content to understand your current compliance posture."
        },
        {
          q: "Is MapMyGap a replacement for professional auditors?",
          a: "No, MapMyGap is a tool to assist with compliance analysis, not a replacement for professional auditors. It helps you identify gaps and prepare for audits, but you should still work with qualified compliance professionals for final validation and implementation."

      questions: [
        {
          q: "How accurate is the AI analysis?",
          a: "Our AI is trained on extensive compliance frameworks and provides highly accurate analysis. However, accuracy depends on the quality and clarity of your uploaded documents. We recommend reviewing all AI outputs with qualified professionals."
        },
        {
          q: "What frameworks do you support?",
          a: "We currently support NIST 800-53, NIST CSF, ISO 27001:2022, SOC 2 Type II, and PCI DSS v4.0. We're continuously adding new frameworks based on user demand."
        },
        {
          q: "How do you handle sensitive documents?",
          a: "Documents are processed securely in real-time and not permanently stored. We use enterprise-grade encryption and security measures. Documents are automatically deleted after 30 days, and we never share your content with third parties."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I export my analysis results?",
          a: "Yes, you can export your analysis results in multiple formats including PDF reports, Excel spreadsheets, and JSON data for integration with other tools."
        },
        {
          q: "What if the AI makes a mistake?",
          a: "While our AI is highly accurate, it's designed to assist, not replace human judgment. All outputs should be reviewed by qualified professionals. We provide detailed explanations for each analysis to help you understand the reasoning."

      questions: [
        {
          q: "What's the difference between 'covered', 'partial', and 'gap'?",
          a: "'Covered' means the control is fully implemented and documented. 'Partial' means some aspects are implemented but may need enhancement. 'Gap' means the control is not implemented or documented."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I validate the AI recommendations?",
          a: "Review each recommendation against your actual implementation, consult with your compliance team, and cross-reference with official framework documentation. The AI provides guidance, but final decisions should be made by qualified professionals."

          q: "Can I use this for audit preparation?",
